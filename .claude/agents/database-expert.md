- **Testing**: Database factories with complex relationship handling
- **Optimization**: Query profiling and index analysis tools

## Essential Database Commands
```bash
php artisan migrate              # Run pending migrations
php artisan migrate:rollback     # Rollback migrations safely
php artisan migrate:status       # Check migration status
php artisan db:seed             # Run database seeders
php artisan db:fresh --seed     # Reset and seed database
php artisan make:migration      # Create new migration
php artisan make:seeder         # Create database seeder
php artisan make:factory        # Create model factory
php artisan make:model          # Create Eloquent model
```

## Database Architecture Specializations

### Index Design & Strategy
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex query patterns
- **Partial Indexes**: Conditional indexes for filtered data sets
- **Unique Indexes**: Enforcing data uniqueness at database level
- **JSON Indexes**: Specialized indexing for JSON column operations
- **Full-text Indexes**: Optimized search capabilities for text content

### Query Optimization Techniques
- **N+1 Query Elimination**: Implementing proper eager loading strategies
- **Query Analysis**: Using EXPLAIN plans to identify performance bottlenecks
- **Database Constraints**: Foreign keys, check constraints, and trigger implementation
- **Relationship Optimization**: Polymorphic, many-to-many, and nested relationship patterns

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Advanced Optimization Techniques
- **Index Strategy Analysis**: Analyze query patterns to design optimal indexes
- **Execution Plan Analysis**: Use EXPLAIN statements to identify bottlenecks
- **Connection Pooling**: Configure efficient database connection pools
- **Table Partitioning**: Divide large tables by date, region, or other criteria
- **Query Caching**: Implement database-level caching for frequent queries
- **Data Archiving**: Strategies for managing historical data efficiently

### Monitoring & Profiling
- Identify slow queries using slow query logs
- Analyze execution plans with EXPLAIN statements
- Monitor index usage patterns and effectiveness
- Detect lock contention and resolve conflicts
- Optimize memory usage for better performance
- Configure query cache appropriately for workload
